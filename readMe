now i want to take save input from the modal popup form and save it into local storage for the day for which the form is submitted and also i want to make that cell look a bit different to show that an event is saved for that cell. Dont give me the code just a detailed step by step instructions. I want to code by myself
Perfect â€” Iâ€™ll give you a clear **step-by-step plan** so you can build it yourself without code handed to you. Letâ€™s break it down:

---

## âœ… Step-by-Step Instructions

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Capture Form Submission**

* Add a `submit` event listener to your form (`#eventForm`).
* Inside that listener:

  * Prevent default form behavior.
  * Get values from all the form fields (`title`, `date`, `time`, `description`).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Structure the Event Data**

* Create an object to represent the event (e.g., `{ title, time, description }`).
* Use the selected date (`YYYY-MM-DD` format) as the **key**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Save to Local Storage**

* Retrieve existing events from `localStorage` (parse JSON or fallback to `{}`).
* Add your new event under the appropriate date key.

  * If multiple events per day: use an array.
* Save the updated object back to `localStorage`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Close the Modal**

* After saving, hide the modal (`classList.add("hidden")`).
* Optionally reset the form.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Modify Calendar Rendering to Show Saved Events**

* In your `render` function (for both `monthView` and `weekView`):

  * Retrieve events from `localStorage`.
  * For each day cell you render:

    * Convert its date to `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
    * Check if that date exists in the saved events.
    * If it does, **add a class or visual indicator** (like a dot or background color).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **6. Style Cells With Events**

* Decide on a visual cue:

  * A subtle colored dot.
  * A border.
  * A background like `bg-yellow-100`.
* Apply the style conditionally during rendering when events are found.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **7. Optional: Show a Tooltip or Summary on Hover**

* You can show the event title on hover using `title` attribute or a custom tooltip if you want extra polish.

---

## ðŸ§  Tip

Keep your event storage simple at first, like:

```json
{
  "2025-06-27": [{ "title": "Meeting", "time": "14:00", "description": "Discuss roadmap" }]
}
```

Then build on that as needed (editing/deleting, etc.).

Let me know once you try it â€” Iâ€™m happy to help debug or refine your implementation!
